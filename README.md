# AutoCorrector

Auto Correct is a Python script that suggests corrections for misspelled words using the enchant library. It utilizes the edit distance algorithm to find the word with the minimum edit distance from the input word and suggests it as a correction.

## Usage

> Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.

> Run the script: python auto_correct.py

> Follow the prompts to enter a word.

> The script will check if the word is already correct. If it is, it will display a message stating that. If not, it will suggest a corrected word based on the minimum edit distance.

> Enter 'q' to quit the script.
